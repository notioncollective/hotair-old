Roadmap

1. First draft of all graphics in place, gameplay lifecycle in full operation. The game is fully "playable" but may not be as visually impressive.
2. Alpha testing.
3. Refined graphics, fine-tuned game behavior. Respond to alpha testing feedback to make gameplay more fun. Improve visual appearance.
4. Beta launch.
